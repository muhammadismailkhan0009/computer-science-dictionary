## Word: Test Driven Development
### Description:
TDD is the software development approach in which we write the failing test of the action we want to code. Then we write the code of the action that passes the previously written test. Then we again write the failing test, and then code to pass that test. This iteration process continues for whole application development.  
In simple form: write test -> write code to pass the test -> write test -> write code to pass the test ......

## Word: Unit Testing
### Decription:
Unit testing is TDD approach in which single methods/units of code are tested to see if they work, and are providing desired results.  
For example, Let's say your calculator application contains methods such as addition, and multiplication. Here, addition, is independent methods, while multiplication depends upon additoin. You may unit test additon by calling method on two random numbers to check if it is giving correct results.  
Once addition passes your tests, you can then use addition method to write multiplication logic without worrying about whether addition method will give wrong results.  
This way, if some error occurs, you can be sure that the error is not in addition method.

## Word: Job Scheduling
### Description:
Job Scheduling is the way of executing actions at specific time, either once or repitively. For example, you can schedule a random number generator to generate random numbers after every 2 hours.

## Word: Payment Gateway
### Description:
Payment gateway is a service used by organizations to sell their products and get the payment online from customers.  
Most companies use already built payment gateways instead of building their own for payment related actions.  
A payment gateway can be added into the application/project by following the guidelines provided by the gateway providing companies.  
Some common examples of payment gateways are PayPal, Paddle, fastSpring etc.

## Word: Internet Standard
### Description:
Internet standard refers to approved guidelines that provide information about the correct use of a specific technology. For example, Internet Standard document [RFC 5321](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321) provides guidelines about what SMTP is, and how to use it correctly.  
Internet Standards are approved by Internet Engineering Task Force(IEFT), a standard organization responsible for technical standards for internet.

## Word: Inversion of Control
### Description:
IoC is the programming principle in which the flow of code is controlled by framework rather than by yourself. In simple terms, instead of you calling the functions in your code to use them, the framework does this for you. You just have to initialize the class object with dependency injection into you code where you want to use the function.

## Word: Secure Shell Protocol
### Description:
SSH protocol is the is a method of secure remote login from one computer to another computer. For example, you want to access your cloud server system on your personal computer. You will use secure shell protocol(ssh) to access the remote server securely.

## Word: ssh-key
### Description:
ssh-key is the secure, cryptographically generated key that is used in ssh protocol to have secure remote login from one computer to another. You generate ssh-key on the server you want to have remote access to(e.g. your cloud server), and you insert the key into the system you want to have remote access from(e.g your personal computer).

## Word: Version Control
### Description:
Version control is a system which allows us to manage changes in our code, and keep track of the the changes.  
A simple example of version control system is GitHub. It allows changes in code as well as keep record of all the changes occured.

## Word: Git
### Description:
Git is a version control and collaboration software used to track changes in any set of files.  
Git is different from Github in the sense that Github is one of many GUI implementations of Git. GitLab is another implementation that uses Git.

## Word: Servlet
### Description:
Servelet is a small java program that runs inside a web server. A servlet ususally receives and responds to requests from web client(browser).  
For example, you build function that will add two numbers. You write a piece of code that will take numbers which are inputted into browser webpage, and shall return the result to the browser. That piece of code is called servlet.
