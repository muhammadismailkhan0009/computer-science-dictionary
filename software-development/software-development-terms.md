# Software Development Changes

## Word: Test Driven Development

### Description:
TDD is the software development approach in which we write the failing test of the action we want to code. Then we write the code of the action that passes the previously written test. Then we again write the failing test, and then code to pass that test. This iteration process continues for whole application development.  
In simple form: write test -> write code to pass the test -> write test -> write code to pass the test ......
